<p>As &#34;It&#39;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&#34; plays on the radio in one continuous loop, this past weekend belonged to Krampus and the adults that are taking part in their own holiday experience.</p>

<p>Krampus is seemingly everywhere: the old Austrian folklore has exploded into the mainstream over the last couple of years. Three horror movies about the creature was made in 2015 alone &#8211; two straight to DVD films, with the third, released December 4 by Universal Pictures, being a box office success. Also, Krampus night or Krampusnachut just took place on December 5: it is a night filled with parades, debauchery and fun, as individuals dress like the beast and roam the streets scaring and partying.</p>

<p>&#34;America loves Halloween,&#34; Kel McBride, Bloomington Krampus parade organizer, said. &#34;Krampus Night and the legend of this alpine beast is a story of accountability with a dose of fright that is perfect for a wintertime celebration.&#34;</p>

<p>There have been various organizations taking part in this annual event, which is supposed to lead into December 6, aka Saint Nicholas Day. In Dallas, the Krampus Society had their yearly parade, which has grown from just three people to 100s. In a similar event in Bloomington, Indiana, the creature is under the control of Santa Claus, but is unleashed on the town after the festivities, causing havoc in the name of good fun. These are just two of the many celebrations that are sprouting up throughout America. But what exactly is Krampus and why have people seemingly adopted it out of nowhere?</p>

<p>&#34;Simplest way to describe Krampus is he is a counterpart to Santa Claus. Santa Claus is known for giving to the good. Krampus is there to punish the bad,&#34; said Allen Hopps, Krampus enthusiast and monster creator for StiltBeast Studios.</p>

<p>While there are different iterations of the beast, he mostly appears as a horned, goat-like creature with large teeth and a long tongue. He also carries chains, which signifies a connection to hell, or birch branches to swat naughty children. While his specific origins are unclear &#8211; the combination of centuries old pagan rituals and the idea of forcing children to do their chores make up Krampus&#39; background, according to Hopps &#8211; he has been lumped, for better or worse, with Christmas, becoming a companion to jolly Saint Nick.</p>

<p>Despite Krampus being suppressed by the Catholic Church and fascist governments in the 20th Century, the traditions have been revived in Europe over the last few decades. As for the United States, it has only caught on in the past few years. For the Krampus enthusiasts, this is due to two reasons: the way Christmas is now celebrated and the folklore&#39;s overall message.</p> 

<p>&#34;People are really relating it to Christmas: [the holiday] is so over-commercialized and in the states, everything is politically correct that people are sick of it,&#34; said Daniel Baker, founder of the Krampus Society and organizer of the Dallas parade.</p>

<p>The notion of accountability also rings true with Krampus. Centuries ago, if children were good and did all of their chores &#8211; something that was very important to families that needed the harvest for winter &#8211; then Krampus would not take the little ones to hell. Allen Hopps, who used to procrastinate a lot, uses the creature as his personal motivation: &#34;Krampus is coming, do your work,&#34; he jokingly tells himself.</p>

<p>Simply, the beast is a counter culture&#39;s take on Christmas: something for adults to look forward to amidst a very materialistic holiday. &#34;I appreciate the accountability aspect of the tale and, on the night of the event, I revel in the screams of terror and joy,&#34; said Kel McBride.</p>
